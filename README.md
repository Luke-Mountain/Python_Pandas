# Python Data Analysis Project  

This repository contains a Python project developed during a **Data Technician Bootcamp**, focusing on using **pandas** and data visualization libraries to explore, clean, and analyze **retail and sales data**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights  

- **Data Exploration & Filtering**  
  - Loaded and inspected retail and sales datasets using pandas.  
  - Applied filtering techniques to focus on relevant subsets of data.  
  - Used `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` for precise subsetting by labels and indexes.  

- **Data Manipulation**  
  - Aggregated and summarized data with `groupby()`.  
  - Ordered results using `sort_values()`.  
  - Cleaned missing values with `dropna()` and `fillna()`.  
  - Created new calculated columns to enrich the dataset.  

- **Data Visualization**  
  - Generated quick insights with pandas’ built-in plotting functions.  
  - Created bar charts, line charts, and histograms using **matplotlib**.  
  - Visualized sales trends, product performance, and regional comparisons.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  

- Data cleaning and preparation with **pandas**  
- Subsetting with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`  
- Using `groupby()` for aggregations and summaries  
- Sorting and handling missing values  
- Visualizing trends with **matplotlib** and pandas plotting  
- Extracting insights from real-world retail and sales data

## 🚀 How to Explore  

1. Review the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) in this repository.  
2. Open them in **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**, or another Python environment.  
3. Run the code to see how pandas and matplotlib were used to explore and visualize the retail and sales data.
